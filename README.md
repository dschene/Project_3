# Project 3 - Apple disease prediction

This repo contains all the code for third project. Some additional instructions:

> The different scripts can be execute from the 'sh' folder. 

> Training and test data should go in a folder named 'data' within the main project directory (same level as the other folders such as 'sh' and 'project_modules')

    > Contained within the Train and Test folders should be the folders with images from the different classes, where each folder name corresponds to the class label (and all images within that folder are logically from that specific class)

    > An example dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification)

> Two trained models, a custom and a resnet model, are already present in the directory which means that users don't have to train and test a new model themselves. 

> Simply execute the 'launch_app.sh' from the sh directory to start the application
